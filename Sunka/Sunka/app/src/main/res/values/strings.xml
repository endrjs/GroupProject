        \n\nTraditionally, Sunka is played on an oblong wooden block with two rows of seven circular trays and a larger circular tray at each end of the board.  The larger trays at both ends of the board are called stores.  Players sit opposite to one another and the store on a player\'s righthand side is that player\'s store.  The row of seven small trays on a player\'s side belong to that player.  The small trays in the other row belong to the opponent.
        \n\nThe game is played with 98 shells.  Initially, these shells are distributed equally across the 14 smaller trays, such that each tray contains 7 shells.  The objective of the game is to collect as many shells in one\'s own store as possible.
        \n\n<u><b>Basic of moving shells</b></u>
        \n\nPlayers take turns playing the game. In each move, a player:
        \n\n     1. Chooses one of the seven small trays on their side of the board.
        \n     2. Removes all the shells from that tray.
        \n     3. Redistributes the shells by navigating the trays in an anti-clockwise fashion and dropping one shell in each tray, including the player\'s own small trays, the player\'s own store and the opponent\'s small trays.
        \n\n<u><b>Rules governing moves</b></u>
        \n\nIn the first turn of the game, both players begin redistributing shells according to the principles explained above simultaneously.  The first player to finish their move is the one who gets to move in the second turn.  After the first turn, players move alternately.
        \n\nIf the last shell that is redistributed in a move drops in the player\'s own store, then the player gets an additional move.  Note that such bonus moves can be accumulated.
        \n\nIf the last shell that is redistributed in a move drops in an empty small tray (not the store) on the player\'s own side, then that shell and all the shells in the corresponding tray on the opposite side (i.e. the opponent\'s side) are captured and moved to the player\'s store.
        \n\nA player must make a move in his/her turn when one is possible.  If a player cannot make a move in his/her turn (because there are no shells in any of the small trays on his/her side), that player must pass until a move is possible in a future turn.
        \n\n<u><b>Game over</b></u>
        \n\nThe game ends when there are no more shells in any of the small trays.  The winner at that point is the player who has the most shells in his/her store.</string>
